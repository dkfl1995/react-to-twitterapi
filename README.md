# react-to-twitterapi
Task to create a simple webapp to show public user twitter timelines, of user you tap into app.

Hi there! 

Here is a little project that makes possible to call and get from Twitter API public user timelines you choose. If you want
to do this, just enter the login name of user you want to see and press submit button.
You will see last thousands of tweets, user post.

NOTE: as this project does not define user permissions and not require to authentificate to Twitter, you will not capable to change posts,
do comments. You will able just watch on public accounts only, with public non-user rights.
